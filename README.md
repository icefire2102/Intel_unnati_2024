PROJECT: Develop a 2D Occupancy Grid Map of a Room using Overhead Cameras
In this project, I utilized ROS 2 Foxy and Gazebo to create a 2D occupancy grid map of a room using overhead cameras. The aim was to accurately represent the spatial layout and occupancy of the environment. I set up a simulated room in Gazebo, where overhead cameras captured real-time data. By processing this visual information with ROS 2, I implemented algorithms to detect and classify occupied and free spaces, ultimately generating a detailed occupancy grid. This project demonstrates the integration of robotics simulation and computer vision for effective environment mapping, paving the way for applications in navigation and autonomous systems.
